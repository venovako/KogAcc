## Building

### Prerequisites

A recent Linux (e.g., CentOS 7.9 with devtoolset-11), macOS (e.g., Big Sur), or Windows (e.g., 10) is needed.

Other 64-bit OSes (e.g., Oracle Solaris) might also be supported to a certain extent.

GNU, Intel, and NVidia Fortran compilers should work, while the others might require tweaking the build system.

### Make options

On Linux or macOS, run ``make help`` (GNU make assumed).

On antoher \*nix OS where GNU `make` is not the default one, run ``gmake help`` instead.

On Windows, run ``nmake help`` in the Intel oneAPI command prompt.
